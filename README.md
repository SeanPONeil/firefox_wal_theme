# firefox_wal_theme
A firefox theme which uses [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) colors!

To install put userChrome.css in `/home/<usr>/.mozilla/firefox/<something>.default/chrome/` and change the 1st line of the file to your user path. This is a big bodge to force firefox to use my system colours, so don't try to make sense of the code!
